Rules/laws from lecture slides:
* Usability 
    * You must balance between what the users wants/needs are and the realities of the site owners  wants/needs 
    * The visual form of a site should relate to its function 
    * Appropriately respect GUI and Web interface conventions 
    * YOU are NOT the USER 
    * USERS are NOT DESIGNERS 
    * Design for common, account for differences 
    * Users are REAL PEOPLE 
    * There is no absolute idea of what constitutes a usable site. Usability will vary as much as the users accessing the site 
    * Usability depends on the medium of consumption (think back to the onscreen, on paper, by audio, etc problem) 
    * Usability depends on the type of site as well as the user’s familiarity with it 
    * Usability and user satisfaction are directly related 
    * Web browsers do not user sites, people do 
    * Users try to maximize gain and minimize work (the lazy person rule 80/20 Pareto Principle) 
    * 20 percent of the code has 80 percent of the errors. Find them, fix them!
    * Recognition is easier than recall, so don’t force users to memorize information 
    * The amount of time a user will wait is proportional to the expected payoff 
    * Time matters more to a user than bytes delivered (unless user is paying by the byte) 
    * Users bring past experiences with the world, software, and the Web to your site, so make sure you meet these expectations 
* Fitt’s Law 
    * the farther away a target is and the smaller its size then the more difficult it is for the user to correctly land on that target - make clickable regions large enough and close enough to be clicked accurately 
* (X)HTML Rules 
    * HTML is not case sensitive 
    * XHTML is case sensitive 
    * (X)HTML attribute values may be case sensitive 
    * (X)HTML sensitive up to a single whitespace character 
    * (X)HTML elements should be nested, not crossed 
    * (X)HTML follow a content model 
    * Elements should have close tags unless empty 
    * Unused elements may minimize 
    * Attributes should be quoted 
    * Browsers tend to ignore unknown attributes and elements 
* Thomas’ Law of Unintended Consequences 
    * when your actions have unintended consequences and the solutions to address those unintended consequences have their own unintended consequences. (e.g. When people who don’t know MIME fix things for users using MIME). 
* Law of Three 
    * Requests and responses have three pieces 
1. Request/Response Line 
2. Set of headers (terminated by /n/n) 
3. Payload (uncommon on requests other that POST and PUT. common on responses) 
* Prof’s law of “weird stuff” 
    * Focus on constructs in new languages you learn that are odd to you to understand interesting aspects of the language that may vary from what you know from Java, C/C++... 
* Web Performance Golden Rule (of Optimization) 
    * Send little, less often (and close by) 
    * Send as little as you need to as infrequently as you need to if you want to go faster 
    * To improve web site performance, you should aim to send as little data as required and not ask for more data or request data unless you need 
    * “Send little” = compression 
    * “Less often” = caching 
    * “Close by” = reduce latency by traveling less distance 
* The Golden Rule 
    * On the public Web, you truly cannot trust users nor the data they submit 
    * TRUST BUT VERIFY 

Other rules/laws talked about in lecture
* Form follows function (the visual form of a site should relate to its function) 
* Postel’s Principle 
    * Be conservative in what you send, be liberal in what you accept 
    * E.g. Code that sends commands or data to other servers, needs to conform completely to specifications, but code that receives input should accept non-conformant input as long as the meaning is clear. 
* 99% Rule of Development 
    * The first 90% of the code accounts for the first 90% of the development time. The remaining 10% of the code accounts for the other 90% of the development time. 
    * This adds up to 180% because it takes both more time and more resources than expected to make a project work 
* 99% Rule of the Web (Performance) 
    * 90% of a program execution time is spent executing 10% of the code 
* 99% Rule of the Web (Recognition vs Recall) 
    * Make your site similar to the other 99% of sites 
* Iceberg model 
    * Users often only see the results and things above the water 
* There are three types of users 
1. Novices 
2. Infrequent intermediates (most common) 
3. Power users 
* Cialdini’s 6 Principles of Influence (used by Amazon) 
    * Reciprocity (e.g. use amazon’s prime services, and get special benefits) 
    * Commitment and Consistency (e.g. amazon’s site layout hasn’t changed much over the years) 
    * Social Proof (e.g. amazon’s positive reviews and ratings) 
    * Authority (e.g. amazon’s one of the biggest online marketplaces - thus gets to make some of the rules) 
    * Liking (e.g. who doesn’ t like amazon’s well-developed and necessary services) 
    * Scarcity (e.g. amazon’s “only six left in stock” warnings) 
* Nielson’s 5 rules for a successful web app 
1. Learnability 
2. Rememberability 
3. Efficiency of use 
4. Reliability in use 
5. User satisfaction 
* There will always be users who don’t like or get a site, no matter how good it is 
* Just because something stands out and is memorable does not mean it makes sense 
* If we do our job sell, we’ll be transparent and no one will notice us. 
* WYSIWYG 
    * What you see is what you get 
    * E.g. a type of user interface that allows the user to view something very similar to the end result while the document is being created (such as Coda) 
* TRUST BUT VERIFY (the golden rule) 
* Open source is like a free puppy 
* Power tool Problem 
    * When you jump ahead to use tools (like IDE’s) that have more features than you’re familiar with
