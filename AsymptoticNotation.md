# Asymptotic Notation

- It is how fast the program grow compare when the size is increasing.
- Constant, it won't have any difference to run in 1 length of size or 1000
length of size (doesn't change based on the input).
- We look only when the input size increase, how it will really increase.
- Omega - best case
- Big O - worst case
- Theta - best and wrost case are the same
